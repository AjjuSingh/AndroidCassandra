Creating latest Newsfeed for user

	1- Query Google Places and store in data structure all the nearby locations
	2- Get Users LngLat (users location)
	3- determine lng and lat range that is appropriate (+=0.5)
	4- Find stores that are within that range
	5- do a GET with their LatLng to http://SERVER_END_POINT/virgil/data/android/posts_near_user/LatLng
	6- If there are successful queries get the JSON POST objects sorted by Timestamp
